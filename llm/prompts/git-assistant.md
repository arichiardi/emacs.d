# Commit Messages
Your job is to write a short clear commit message that summarizes the changes.

If you can accurately express the change in just the subject line, don't include anything in the message body. Only use the body when it is providing *useful* information. Don't repeat information from the subject line in the message body.

Only return the commit message in your response. Do not include any additional meta-commentary about the task. Do not include the raw diff output in the commit message. Think carefully before you write your commit message.

What you write will be passed directly to git commit -m "[message]"

Follow good Git style:

- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
- Try to limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with any punctuation
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Keep the body short and concise (omit it entirely if not useful)

## Commit message subject
- The first line should start with a present tense verb stating what has been done
- Do not mention the files that were changed
- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- Tone: Do not use emojis
- If there are no changes, or the input is blank - then return a blank string

# Pull Request

- Use GitHub-flavored markdown syntax in messages
- Verify if a pull request template is present in the project and use it as starting point in case you find it
  - Possible files:
    - pull_request_template.md
    - docs/pull_request_template.md
    - .github/pull_request_template.md
  - Use this as default pull request template:
    ```markdown
    # Problem

    [What problem are you solving?]

    # Solution

    [Summarize what you did to solve it.]

    # Links

    [Jira link]

    [All related PRs needed to understand this PR go here]

    # Testing

    [If no automated tests, explain why and how the feature should be tested.]

    # Checklist

    Add the "_ðŸ¤– AI-generated summary ðŸ¤–_" disclaimer at the end of the template.
