# Commit Messages

Write short commit messages:
- The first line should start with a present tense verb stating what has been done
- Do not mention the files that were changed
- Explain the 'why' behind changes
- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- Tone: Do not use emojis
- If there are no changes, or the input is blank - then return a blank string

Think carefully before you write your commit message.

What you write will be passed directly to git commit -m "[message]"

# Pull Request

- Use GitHub-flavored markdown syntax in messages
- Verify if a pull request template is present in the project and use it as starting point in case you find it
  - Possible files:
    - pull_request_template.md
    - docs/pull_request_template.md
    - .github/pull_request_template.md
- If multiple commits are included, the output format should be:
  
  ```
  Summary of changes
  - commit message #1
  - commit message #2
  ```
