;;; early-init.el --- The early initialization. -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; This is take from doom-emacs.
;;
;; Emacs HEAD (27+) introduces early-init.el, which is run before init.el,
;; before package and UI initialization happens.

;;; Code:

;; Defer garbage collection further back in the startup process
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum)

;; In noninteractive sessions, prioritize non-byte-compiled source files to
;; prevent the use of stale byte-code. Otherwise, it saves us a little IO time
;; to skip the mtime checks on every *.elc file.
(setq load-prefer-newer noninteractive)

;; In Emacs 27+, package initialization occurs before `user-init-file' is
;; loaded, but after `early-init-file'. Doom handles package initialization, so
;; we must prevent Emacs from doing it early!
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
(advice-add #'package--ensure-init-file :override #'ignore)

;; Prevent the glimpse of un-styled Emacs by disabling these UI elements early.
(setq tool-bar-mode nil
      menu-bar-mode nil)
(when (fboundp 'set-scroll-bar-mode)
  (set-scroll-bar-mode nil))

;; Resizing the Emacs frame can be a terribly expensive part of changing the
;; font. By inhibiting this, we easily halve startup times with fonts that are
;; larger than the system default.
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)

;; Ignore X resources; its settings would be redundant with the other settings
;; in this file and can conflict with later config (particularly where the
;; cursor color is concerned).
;; (advice-add #'x-apply-session-resources :override #'ignore)

;; Set eln-cache dir: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/70478

  (startup-redirect-eln-cache (expand-file-name "~/.cache/eln-cache" user-emacs-directory)))
